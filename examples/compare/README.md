# Compare examples

These are examples with IACA marks for assembly inspection/comparison etc.

## How to use them

In order to compile these examples you can integrate them into fast-cpp-compare by symlinking the `src__*` folders into `fast-asm-compare` and symlink everything from `ext/` in `fast-asm-compare/ext` (might be done automatically by `prepare.sh`) then modify `fast-asm-compare/CMakeLists.txt` to include the right folders. Or you can just replace the contents of `main.cpp`.
