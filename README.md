# boost.simd_playground

This is just a public repo to keep an online backup of my work at the LRI. The roadmap is detailed [here](./TODO.md).

You'll also find my dev blog about the project [here](http://www.penuch.it/boost.simd_playground/), which is basically a compilation of benchmarks, insights and remarks about [boost.simd](https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd).

## Installation/Dependencies

The main requirements are :

-	CMake
-	NPM

To get the project ready to build simply execute ```./prepare``` and all the dependencies will be downloaded automatically.
